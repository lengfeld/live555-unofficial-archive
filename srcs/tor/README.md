I have received an email in the last days. The sender of the email pointed me
to the additional live555 tarball archive.

    http://wex5mlqtzj6mxjwkcugoadlzgwh5qvfuympen2iolo5lep762ramjsqd.onion/

It's by far the biggest live555 tarball archive I have seen until now. It
contains 688 tarballs.  That is 68% of all released live555 versions!

I have downloaded all of the archives in this folder. Four archives are removed
for now

    $ ls -1 | grep .away
    live.2003.11.12.tar.gz.away
    live.2004.03.31.tar.gz.away
    live.2005.04.01.tar.gz.away
    live.2012.05.15.tar.gz.away

because the dates can not be found in the official changelog. Mostly they are
just shifted by one day.

2024-08-30: Thanks again to the sender of the mail and the maintainer of this
archive. Nice work!

2025-07-31: No new tarball updates on this site. Latest tarball is
`live.2024.08.01.tar.gz`.
