<h1 id="live555-unofficial-archive">live555 unofficial archive</h1>
<p>This project is an unofficial archive of the source code of the <a
href="http://live555.com/liveMedia/">LIVE555 Streaming Media
libraries</a>. It collects the source tarballs released on the server <a
href="http://live555.com/liveMedia/public/">live555.com/liveMedia/public/</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it?</h2>
<p>All collected tarballs are listed briefly in the <a
href="table.html">tarball table</a>. For more information for a specific
tarball, e.g. including checksums and the changelog, see the <a
href="list.html">tarball list</a>. Both sites contain download links to
the tarballs.</p>
<p>If you want to work with the code directly in a git repository,
please have a look at <a
href="https://github.com/lengfeld/live555-unofficial-git-archive">live555-unofficial-git-archive</a>.
It’s a repository that contains all collected live555 tarballs.</p>
<p>Example usage:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/lengfeld/live555-unofficial-git-archive.git
$ cd live555-unofficial-git-archive
$ git tag  # list all versions/tags
$ git diff v2024.04.19-tree v2024.05.05-tree  # compare two versions

# Checkout the source code without creating a branch
$ git switch --detach v2024.04.19-tree</code></pre>
<p><em>Note</em>: The tags have the suffix <code>-tree</code>. The git
tags point to commit objects without a history. They only contain the
file contents of the tarballs. So <code>git log</code> does not
work!</p>

<h3 id="why-was-this-project-created">Why was this project created?</h3>
<p>The original author of the libraries does not maintain historical
versions of the source code. The reasons are stated in the <a
href="http://live555.com/liveMedia/faq.html#no-source-code-repository">FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do you not make the code available under a ‘source code
repository’?</p>
<p>Unlike some other open source projects, the source code for this
project is provided as a ‘tarball’, rather than in a source code
repository - because old versions of the code are not supported. (A
source code repository might also encourage developers to extend the
source code by modifying it ‘in place’ (and then upgrading the code by
‘merging diffs’). As noted above, modifying the supplied code ‘in place’
is something that we discourage; instead, developers should use C++
subclassing to extend the code.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can follow the reasoning that only the newest and current version
is supported. That’s a fair decision.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I also value traceability. This means that you can
follow the development process. E.g. when a bug was fixed or a feature
was introduced. This can only achieved if you have a development history
as a source code repository or historical archives. Relying on third
parties for this goal has a couple of issues.</p>
<h3 id="are-the-tarballs-authentic">Are the tarballs authentic?</h3>
<p>You will never know for sure! Since the original author does not
maintain a reference archive of the historical source code, you have to
rely on third parties, like this project, to provide the old tarballs.
Since the published tarballs are not signed by the original author, you
can only rely on trust.</p>
<p>I can assure that the tarballs I collected should be fine and
authentic. Nevertheless you have to trust me for this. For the other
tarballs, that are collected from third parties archives, like gentoo,
you have to trust them.</p>
<p>But the code is open source. Inspecting the code is always
possible.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-use-this-site-as-a-tarball-mirror">Can I use this site as
a tarball mirror?</h3>
<p>Not yet. For now the links to the live555 tarballs are direct links
into the git repository on github. I don’t consider these links as
stable. They may change in the future.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is definitely planed and reasonable. There will be a
single directory that contains all tarballs and has stable links. So it
can be used like other distributions or software project source code
archives.</p>

<p>The project is hosted on github in the repository <a

If you like to contribute, open a PR or create an issue. Especially new
sources of historical tarballs are welcome. The goal of this project is
to have the most complete set of source code archives for live555.</p>
<p>If you have questions, just send me a <a

<h2 id="prior-art">Prior Art</h2>
<p>The need for a live555 tarball backup is also seen by other people. I
know of the following sister projects that also provide an up to date
tarball backup:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://github.com/museoa/live555-backups">github.com/museoa/live555-backups</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://src.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/files/src/live555/">src.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/files/src/live555/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The following project added the tarballs including the changelog text
as git commits:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://github.com/rayl/live555">github.com/rayl/live555</a></li>
